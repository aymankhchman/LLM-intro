# Playing with LLaMA 3 Instruct

Welcome to my little experiment with LLaMA 3 Instruct from Hugging Face! This is just a fun intro to using large language models (LLMs) for generating text and chatting.

## What's This About?

LLMs like LLaMA 3 are really good at understanding and generating human-like text. Here, I'm using it to show off some basic text generation and chat capabilities.

## Shoutouts

Big thanks to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for their awesome Transformers library and LLaMA 3 model.
